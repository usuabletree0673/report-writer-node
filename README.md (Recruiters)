# Report Writer Node

## Section 1: For Recruiters & Strategy Leads

### What It Is  
A lightweight AI-powered tool that transforms structured data (like CSVs or operational tables) into clean, decision-ready reports using OpenAI’s GPT models. Designed to cut report writing time from hours to seconds.

### Why It Matters  
Most teams waste time manually converting performance data into readable updates. This node auto-generates:
- Executive summaries
- Weekly operational briefs
- Change-over-time narratives

It bridges the gap between raw data and usable communication — especially useful in environments with high reporting overhead or limited analyst support.

### Problem It Solves  
- Analysts stuck doing repetitive report writing  
- Teams lacking time to summarize data across departments  
- Managers needing clarity without deep spreadsheet dives

### Who Would Use This  
- Ops leads, product managers, finance analysts, internal comms  
- Any org with recurring reporting needs that pull from tabular data

### What Decisions It Enables  
- “What changed since last week?”  
- “What should I pay attention to in this report?”  
- “Is this performance data within normal bounds?”

## Section 2: For Technical Reviewers

### Data Sources  
- Accepts CSV uploads via Streamlit  
- Tested with synthetic and real business performance data  
- Columns must include at least one datetime or version-tracking field for time-based comparison

Frontend: Streamlit (app.py)

Backend: Python modules (utils/analysis.py)

LLM: OpenAI GPT-4, with system prompts customized per report type

## Models & Logic

Templates adapt for summary, trend shift, or item-level breakdown

Prompts structured to reduce hallucination and increase precision

Optional logic fork for multi-report output types (in development)

## Tradeoffs

Depends on clean, labeled input columns

Not yet connected to live data sources — file uploads only

Interpretability prioritized over exhaustiveness

## Known Limitations

No authentication layer — not production-secure

Reports may be generic if context columns are missing

GPT-4 output requires light review before final delivery in enterprise environments
